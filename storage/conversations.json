      "answer": "AI has a transformative impact on modern education systems by improving accessibility, personalization, and scalability of learning. It enables adaptive learning platforms that respond to students' progress in real-time and provides educators with tools for grading, content recommendations, and automated feedback. Studies indicate that 72% of students reported an improvement in their learning pace with AI tools, and teachers experienced a reduced administrative workload. Ultimately, AI serves as a catalyst for improving learning efficiency and engagement, not as a replacement for teachers.",
